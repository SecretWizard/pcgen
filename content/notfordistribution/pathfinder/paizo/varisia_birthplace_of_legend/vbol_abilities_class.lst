#Bound to the Land (Ex): A thundercaller gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her level on Handle Animal checks, Knowledge (nature) checks, and Survival checks. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

#Bardic Performance: A thundercaller gains the following types of bardic performance.

#Thunder Call (Su): At 3rd level, the thundercaller can use her performance to unleash a deafening peal of thunder.
#This allows the thundercaller to spend a round of performance to create an effect similar to the spell sound burst (having the same range and area and allowing the same saving throw).
#At 7th level, the sonic damage that is dealt by this blast of sound increases to 3d8.
#This damage further increases to 5d8 at 11th level, 7d8 at 15th level, and 9d8 at 19th level.
#This performance replaces inspire competence.

#Incite Rage (Su): At 6th level, the thundercaller can induce a furious rage in one creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as the rage spell and lasts as long as the target
#can hear the thundercaller’s performance. Unwilling creatures can be affected if they fail a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the thundercaller’s level + the thundercaller’s Cha modifier).
#Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. The thundercaller cannot target herself with this ability. If the target has the rage class feature, it can instead
#immediately rage and stay in this rage without consuming rounds of rage per day as long as the thundercaller continues performing. This mind-affecting effect requires audible
#components. This performance replaces suggestion and mass suggestion.

#Call Lightning (Su): At 8th level, the thundercaller can use her performance to summon bolts of lightning, as per the spell call lightning. The lightning storm lasts for as long as
#she continues her performance, calling down one bolt of lightning per round. The damage of these lightning bolts can be increased in stormy areas or can be limited as call lightning
#describes. This performance replaces dirge of doom.

#Call Lightning Storm (Su): At 14th level, the thundercaller can use her performance to summon bolts of lightning, as per the spell call lightning storm. The lightning storm lasts
#for as long as she continues her performance, calling down one bolt of lightning per round. The damage of these lightning bolts can be increased in stormy areas or can be limited as
#call lightning describes. This performance replaces frightening tune.
